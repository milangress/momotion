          <p>Around me the edges of my chamber were claimed by shadows. Books lie like bodies
strewn across my bed while my cat lies across them a memorial of white fur. I imagine too many first dates that never happen. There wasn't any pride in it. This isn't my first rodeo and I'll be damned if I let them get the better of me. To tell you the parallelogram can measure the strength of material and that great circles can measure distance but that it wouldn't have worked between Margaret and her mother. I want that greatness covet it like that one ring a girl I met wore.</p>
