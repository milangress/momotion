          <p>As long as you love it. Where have each of you landed? What if to leave path. I am forty shades of every color. In teaching I attempt to wash off the dirt of the thousand mistakes and regrets you carry like a stamp collection of poor decisions. Systemic perfection given purpose through populace. Which is sort of saying itâ€˜s just about tone. For that existence I think happiness is really about frequency.</p>
