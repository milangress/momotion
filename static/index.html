        <p>MOTION POETRY is an interactive research experiment which translates movement into text. All the poems you see are created only with a phone and its accelerometers.</p>
        <p>How does it work? It all starts with pressing the start button on the mobile version of this page. From now on your movement data is collected and you can start your performance. The movements are beeing split up and will be annotated automatically. While a slow and continuous movement might be translated to something like ‚calm‘ or ‚flowing‘, something more rapid and edgy could end up as ‚mechanical‘ or ‚rushing‘. To every annotation like such theres a big pool of words which is connected to this specific topic and the program chooses them randomly and puts them into a pre given grammar. You can later title and save your very own poem.</p>
